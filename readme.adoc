# Pure `MSP430FR5994` firmware in C++

## Features

* Depends **only** on:
** `msp430-elf-` GCC 9.x toolchain
** `mspdebug` programmer
** `cmake`
* Cost-free abstractions:
Device drivers are inline methods of data-less template classes, so they take no memory and compile usually to a single *asm* instruction.
