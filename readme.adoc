== Features

This code depends **only** on:

* `msp430-elf-` GCC 9.x toolchain, found at https://www.ti.com/tool/download/MSP430-GCC-OPENSOURCE[www.ti.com]
* `mspdebug` programmer, found at https://github.com/dlbeer/mspdebug[github.com/dlbeer/mspdebug]
* `cmake`, found in your distribution's repository.

All device drivers are data-less template classes with inline methods, so they take _no memory_ and usually compile to a _single assembly instruction_:

[source,cpp]
----
#include "lib/msp430fr5994.h"

int main()
{
    using namespace MSP430::FR5994;
    wdt_a.stop();
}
----

is compiled into

[source,asm]
----
    mov     #0x5a80, &0x015c
----

== Word, byte, bit-range and bit manipulators

Each device register is manipulable by a set of methods and operators:

[source,cpp,linenums]
----
include::src/DocExamples.cpp[lines=8..]
----
